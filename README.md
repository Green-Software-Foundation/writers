The Writers Program is responsible for producing content to raise issue awareness and help increase institutional interest and investments in green software.

The GSF is a trusted resource on green software practices, tools, resources, and training to reduce the total change in global carbon emissions associated with software. The content we produce must improve knowledge amongst practitioners, providing deeply researched thought pieces and surfacing practical advice from green software leaders and experts for how to apply green principles to software, and take the conversation on green software forward. 

**Contribute to the Writers Program**

The foundation invites software developers, designers, and sustainability leaders in ICT to share their perspectives on the GSF website to help increase institutional interest and investments in green software projects. 

The GSF will favor perspective pieces that offer a unique and detailed perspective on the application of green software principles, patterns, and tools across industries to decarbonize software and advance software towards having zero harmful effects on the environment. The GSF welcomes article submissions from all and is committed to introducing more voices and perspectives from the industry. 

**Editorial Guidelines**
The GSF considers a broad range of article topics related to software sustainability and reducing the carbon emissions of software. We aim to publish articles between 500 - 1,200 words, preferably including graphics, podcasts, and videos. 

In addition, articles should be: 

1. On topic (related to software design, development, operations, and monitoring and measurement to reduce the carbon emissions of software 

2. Fresh (in other words, offer a fresh or unique perspective)

3. Relevant to the challenges and opportunities that exist for enterprises to reduce software’s environmental impact. 

4. Evidence-based (i.e., facts must be backed with supporting research or experience)

5. Educational (i.e., the purpose of the content is to inform and offer guidance, not promote or sell any products or services).


Contributors can re-publish the article on their website or on other interested platforms using proper attribution (e.g., originally published for The Green Software Foundation, with appropriate link). 

_The foundation is under no obligation to publish any submission. The Editorial & Style Guidelines below are shared to support your efforts in contributing articles to the GSF. _

**Style Guide**
 

**Article length? Be Pithy.**
Generally, we will publish features between 500-1,200 words. 


**Subheadings? We like them.**
Subheadings are particularly useful when a feature covers multiple points or is guiding a reader through a process or stages of work. Subheadings should summarize the respective section of your article and provide a quick and easy guide to see what an upcoming section is all about. Subheadings should be in lowercase sentence format, with no period at the end. 


**Link to GSF resources and projects? Please. **
Contributors can refer to our blogs, working group pages, Github Issues, reports, and Use Cases. We encourage individuals to link to previously published GSF material, especially if there is data on our site, or case studies that can offer more insight on the topics covered in your article. We may embed related links throughout the article to link back to previously published material. 

For links, please hyperlink the most relevant word in a phrase or sentence, and cite reputable publications as opposed to blogs when possible. We will remove hyperlinks that, in our view, are self-promotional or distracting. 


**Include Examples? They will surely help make your point stick.**
Articles that help readers contextualize the problem or opportunity being addressed, relevant to their geography, industry, or field of practice, are helpful. Examples help illustrate the points being made and can help readers grasp the nuances of big ideas. 

 
**Do not include:**

Paid links or mentions 
Plagiarized material 
Unattributed quotes or information 
Copyrighted photos 

 
Every contributor will have access to GSF’s editorial team to support them in their writing journey. If you’re not comfortable with writing, we hope this program encourages you to start and develop your voice in the field. All perspective pieces will go through a round of editing and approval to ensure the article aligns with the foundation’s mission and meets editorial guidelines.
